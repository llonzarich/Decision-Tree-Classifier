# Decision Tree Classifier Implementation and Evaluation

## Project Overview
This project implements a decision tree classifier from scratch using the Top Down Induction for Decision Tree (TDIDT) algorithm.

# Key Focuses
* **Recursive partitioning:** Built the tree from the ground up, with significant attention placed on the underlying mathematical logic. 
* **Mathematical Logic:** Performed entropy calculations and information gain to determine optimal splits.
* **Performance Evaluation:** Validatied model accuracy across various data subsets.

## Technology Stack
* **Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** Numpy

## To Run Unit Tests
Run `pytest --verbose`
* This command runs all the discovered tests in the project
* You can run individual test modules with
    * `pytest --verbose test_myclassifiers.py`
* Note: the `-s` flag can be helpful because it will show print statement output from test execution
