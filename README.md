# Decision Tree Classifier Implementation and Evaluation

## Project Overview
This project implements a decision tree classifier from scratch using the Top Down Induction for Decision Tree (TDIDT) algorithm and evaluating performance on various data subsets. Significant attention is placed on the underlying mathematical logic of recursive partition. 

## Technology Stack
* **Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** Numpy

## To Run Unit Tests
Run `pytest --verbose`
* This command runs all the discovered tests in the project
* You can run individual test modules with
    * `pytest --verbose test_myclassifiers.py`
* Note: the `-s` flag can be helpful because it will show print statement output from test execution
